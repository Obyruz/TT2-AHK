# TT2-AHK <br />
Automated Script for Tap Titans 2 using AutoHotkey(AHK). <br />

Before reading any further, be aware that this script can't be run on the background, i.e. you will not be able to use your computer while it is running, this is due to Nox limitation in regards of accepting keys sent while it is minimized and there's no way to workaround this problem. I might try other emulators/solutions when I consider close to done, aka not many features left and the bot is good to be left 24/7 running without issues. <br />

Recommended: <br />
-Nox emulator <br />
-480x800 resolution <br />

Setup key mapping: <br />
The files inside the nox_keyMapping folder must go in your user Users\<your-user-name>\AppData\Local\Nox\keyboardConfig\com.gamehivecorp.taptitans2\480x800 <br />

Features: <br />
-Customizable GUI(several timers, checkboxes) <br />
-Tap spam(via spacebar) <br />
-Level up Sword Master. <br />
-Level up heroes. <br />
-Level up and use skills. <br />
-Pick up pets whenever available. <br />
-Prestige after X minutes <br />
-Click on fairies and collect rewards(for those with skippable option available) <br />
-Add a checkbox if the user doesn't want to click on fairies(for those without skippable option) <br />

TO DO: <br />
-Enter tournaments. <br />
-Making sure it never gets stuck. <br />
-Things that I can't remember right now. <br />
